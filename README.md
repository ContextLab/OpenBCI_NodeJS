# openbci-sdk

An NPM module for OpenBCI ~ written with love by [Push The World!](www.pushtheworldllc.com)

## Working with the Module

Initialization
--------------

Initializing the board:

```js
var OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci-sdk');
var ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard.OpenBCIBoard();
```

For initializing with options, such as verbose print outs:

```js
var ourBoard = require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard({
    verbose: true
});
```

'ready' event
------------

You MUST wait for the 'ready' event to be emitted before streaming/talking with the board. The ready happens asynchronously 
so installing the 'sample' listener and writing before the ready event might result in... nothing at all.

```js
var ourBoard = new require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        /** Start streaming, reading registers, what ever your heart desires  */
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```

Sample properties:
------------------
* `startByte` (`Number`  should be `0xA0`)
* `sampleNumber` (a `Number` between 0-255) 
* `channelData` (channel data indexed starting at 1 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] filled with floating point `Numbers`)
* `auxData` (aux data indexed starting at 0 [0,1,2] filled with floating point `Numbers`)
* `stopByte` (`Number` should be `0xC0`)

The power of this module is in using the sample emitter, to be provided with samples to do with as you wish.

To get a 'sample' event, you need to:
-------------------------------------
1. Call `.connect(serialPortName)`
2. Install the 'ready' event emitter on resolved promise
3. In callback for 'ready' emitter, call `streamStart()`
4. Install the 'sample' event emitter
```js
var ourBoard = new require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        ourBoard.streamStart();
        ourBoard.on('sample',function(sample) {
            /** Work with sample */
        });
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```
Close the connection with `.streamStop()` and disconnect with `.disconnect()`
```js
var ourBoard = new require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.streamStop().then(ourBoard.disconnect());
```

To start the simulator test samples:
----------
1. Call `.simulatorStart()`
2. In callback for 'ready' emitter, call `streamStart()`
3. Install the 'sample' event emitter
```js
var ourBoard = new require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.simulatorStart().then(function() {
    ourBoard.on('sample',function(sample) {
        /** Work with sample */
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    console.log('Error [simulator]: ' + err);
});
```
To stop the simulator:
```js
ourBoard.simulatorStop()
```

Impedance (signal quality)
--------------------------
Measuring impedance is a vital tool in ensuring great data is collected. 

* **Good** impedance is < 5k Ohms
* **Ok** impedance is 5 to 10k Ohms
* **Bad** impedance is > 10k Ohms

To test for impedance we must apply a known test signal to which either the P, N, or both channels and then apply a little math.

When you start measuring for electrode impedance's, a new additional property called `impedanceArray` (indexed 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), can be found on the sample object from the emitted by 'sample'.

**Note: You must be streaming in order to measure impedance's. Takes up to 2 seconds to start measuring impedances.**

To start measuring all channels impedance's:
```js
var ourBoard = new require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.on('ready',function() {
        ourBoard.impedanceTestStartAll().then(() => {
            ourBoard.streamStart();
        });
        ourBoard.on('sample',function(sample) {
            /** Do normal Sample actions */
            if(sample.impedanceArray) {
                /** Work with impedance array */
            }
        });
    });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```

To stop measuring impedance's:
```js
ourBoard.impedanceTestStopAll();
```

To apply the test signal to a specific input of a specific channel (i.e. Channel 2 test signal applied to P input and not N input):
```js
ourBoard.impedanceTestStartChannel(2,true,false);
```

To stop applying the test signal to a specific channel (i.e. Stop applying signal to channel 2):
```js
ourBoard.impedanceTestStopChannel(2);
```

To stop calculating impedance's every time there is a new sample:
```js
ourBoard.impedanceTestCalculatingStop();
```
You would call `.impedanceTestCalculatingStop()` if you were measuring the impedance for a specified channel. You do NOT need to call `.impedanceTestCalculatingStop()` after calling `.impedanceTestStopAll()` because it is called for you.

Auto-finding boards
-------------------
You must have the OpenBCI board connected to the PC before trying to automatically find it.

If a port is not automatically found, then a list of ports will be returned, this would be a 
good place to present a drop down picker list to the user, so they may manually select the 
serial port name.

```js
var ourBoard = new require('openbci-sdk').OpenBCIBoard();
ourBoard.autoFindOpenBCIBoard().then((value) => {
    if(Array.isArray(value)) {
        /**Unable to auto find OpenBCI board*/
    } else {
        /** 
        * Connect to the board with portName
        * i.e. ourBoard.connect(portName).....
        */
    }
});
```

Reference Guide
---------------
## Methods

### OpenBCIBoard (options)

Create new instance of an OpenBCI board.

**_options (optional)_**

Board optional configurations.

* `baudRate` Baud Rate, defaults to 115200. Manipulating this is allowed if firmware on board has been previously configured.
* `daisy` Daisy chain board is connected to the OpenBCI board. (NOTE: THIS IS IN-OP AT THIS TIME DUE TO NO ACCESS TO ACCESSORY BOARD)
* `verbose` To output more messages to the command line.

**Note, we have added support for either all lowercase OR camelcase of the options, use whichever style you prefer.**

### .autoFindOpenBCIBoard()

Automatically find an OpenBCI board. 

**Note: This will always return an Array of `COM` ports on Windows**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled with a `portName` such as `/dev/tty.*` on Mac/Linux or an 'Array' of all the serial ports.

### .channelOff(channelNumber)

Turn off a specified channel

**_channelNumber_**

A number (1-16) specifying which channel you want to turn off. 

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .channelOn(channelNumber)

Turn on a specified channel

**_channelNumber_**

A number (1-16) specifying which channel you want to turn on. 

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .channelSet(channelNumber,powerDown,gain,inputType,bias,srb2,srb1)

Send a channel setting command to the board.

**_channelNumber_**  

Determines which channel to set. It's a 'Number' (1-16)

**_powerDown_** 

Powers the channel up or down. It's a 'Bool' where `true` turns the channel off and `false` turns the channel on (default)

**_gain_**
 
Sets the gain for the channel. It's a 'Number' that is either (1,2,4,6,8,12,24(default))
  
**_inputType_** 
  
Selects the ADC channel input source. It's a 'String' that **MUST** be one of the following: "normal", "shorted", "biasMethod" , "mvdd" , "temp" , "testsig", "biasDrp", "biasDrn".

**_bias_** 

Selects if the channel shall include the channel input in bias generation. It's a 'Bool' where `true` includes the channel in bias (default) or `false` it removes it from bias.

**_srb2_**

Select to connect (`true`) this channel's P input to the SRB2 pin. This closes a switch between P input and SRB2 for the given channel, and allows the P input to also remain connected to the ADC. It's a 'Bool' where `true` connects this input to SRB2 (default) or `false` which disconnect this input from SRB2.

**_srb1_**
           
Select to connect (`true`) all channels' N inputs to SRB1. This effects all pins, and disconnects all N inputs from the ADC. It's a 'Bool' where `true` connects all N inputs to SRB1 and `false` disconnects all N inputs from SRB1 (default).

**_Returns_** a promise fulfilled if proper commands sent to the write queue, rejects on bad input or no board.

**Example**
```js
ourBoard.channelSet(2,false,24,'normal',true,true,false);
// sends ['x','2','0','6','0','1','1','0','X'] to the command queue
```

### .connect (portName)

The essential precursor method to be called initially to establish a serial connection to the OpenBCI board.

**_portName_**

The system path of the OpenBCI board serial port to open. For example, `/dev/tty` on Mac/Linux or `COM1` on Windows.

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled by a successful serial connection to the board, containing the serial port object that was opened. The promise will be rejected at any time if the serial port has an 'error' or 'close' event emitted.

### .debugSession()

Calls all `.printPacketsBad()`, `.printPacketsRead()`, `.printBytesIn()`

### .disconnect()

Closes the serial port opened by `.connect()`

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled by a successful close of the serial port object, rejected otherwise.

### .getSettingsForChannel(channelNumber)

Gets the specified channelSettings register data from printRegisterSettings call.

**_channelNumber_** 

A number specifying which channel you want to get data on. Only 1-8 at this time.

**Note, at this time this does not work for the daisy board**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the board and the `.processBytes()` function is ready to reach for the specified channel.

### .impedanceTestStartAll()

To apply test signals to all the channels and all inputs on an OpenBCI board. 

**Note, you must be connected in order to set the test commands. Also this method can take up to 2 seconds to send all commands!**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled once all the commands are sent to the board. 

### .impedanceTestStopAll()

To stop applying test signals to all the channels and inputs on an OpenBCI board. 

**Note, you must be connected in order to set the test commands. Also this method can take up to 2 seconds to send all commands!**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled once all the commands are sent to the board. 

### .impedanceTestStartChannel(channelNumber,pInput,nInput)

To apply the impedance test signal to an input for any given channel.

**_channelNumber_** 

A number specifying which channel you want to get apply the test signal to. Only 1-8 at this time.

**_pInput_** 

A bool true if you want to apply the test signal to the P input, false to not apply the test signal.

**_nInput_** 

A bool true if you want to apply the test signal to the N input, false to not apply the test signal.

### .impedanceTestCalculatingStart()

To start calculating impedance's every time there is a new sample.

**Note, this is automatically called by `.impedanceTestStartAll()` and `.impedanceTestStartChannel()`**

### .impedanceTestCalculatingStop()

To stop calculating impedance's every time there is a new sample.

**Note, this is automatically called by `.impedanceTestStopAll()`**

### .numberOfChannels()

Get the current number of channels available to use. (i.e. 8 or 16).

**Note: This is dependent on if you configured the board correctly on setup options. Specifically as a daisy.**

**_Returns_** a number, the total number of available channels.

### .printBytesIn()

### .printPacketsRead()

Prints the total number of packets that were read in this session to the console.

### .printRegisterSettings()

Prints all register settings for the ADS1299 and the LIS3DH on the OpenBCI board.

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .sampleRate()

Get the current sample rate.

**Note: This is dependent on if you configured the board correctly on setup options. Specifically as a daisy.**

**_Returns_** a number, the current sample rate.

### .simulatorStart()

To start simulating an OpenBCI board. 

**Note, must be called after the constructor.**

**_Returns_** a promise, if the simulator was able to start.

### .simulatorStop()

To stop simulating an OpenBCI board. 

**Note, must be called after the constructor.**

**_Returns_** a promise, if the simulator was able to stop.

### .softReset()

Sends a soft reset command to the board.

**Note, this method must be sent to the board before you can start streaming. This triggers the initial 'ready' event emitter.**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .streamStart()

Sends a start streaming command to the board. 

**Note, You must have called and fulfilled `.connect()` AND observed a `'ready'` emitter before calling this method.**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .streamStop()

Sends a stop streaming command to the board. 

**Note, You must have called and fulfilled `.connect()` AND observed a `'ready'` emitter before calling this method.**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

### .write(data)

Send commands to the board. Due to the OpenBCI board firmware, a 10ms spacing **must** be observed between every command sent to the board. This method handles the timing and spacing between characters by adding characters to a global write queue and pulling from it every 10ms.

**_dataToWrite_** 

Either a single character or an Array of characters

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the board has been connected and `dataToWrite` has been added to the write queue

**Example**

Sends a single character command to the board.
```js
// ourBoard has fulfilled the promise on .connected() and 'ready' has been observed previously
ourBoard.write('a');
```

Sends an array of bytes
```js
// ourBoard has fulfilled the promise on .connected() and 'ready' has been observed previously
ourBoard.write(['x','0','1','0','0','0','0','0','0','X']);
```

Taking full advantage of the write queue. The following would be sent at t = 0, 10ms, 20ms, 30ms 
```js
ourBoard.write('t');
ourBoard.write('a');
ourBoard.write('c');
ourBoard.write('o');
```

## Events
